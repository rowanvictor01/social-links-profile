## My process

I first built the card and it's structure using HTML. After that I applied basic design and proceeded on making the layout inside the card using `flexbox`. After creating the layout, I proceeded on designing the individual components that make up the card like the image, texts, and buttons. After putting those together, I made sure the components are fluid and responsive by using `clamp()` to have the components adapt to the screen size of the user.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot on how to use `clamp()` for basic responsiveness and making components fluid and working with units like `vw` and `rem`.

### Continued development

I'll continue on working with responsive design principles and the use of `clamp()`, `vw`, and `rem`. I'll also continue working on making layouts using `flexbox`.
